## Contributing to Qux360

Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ibm/qux360/pulls).

To report vulnerabilities privately, you can contact the authors by email (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruits in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibm/qux360/issues).


Look at the [Installation Instructions](README.md) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/qux360/issues) before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please **FIXME** [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/qux360/issues) before sending a pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```bash
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:

```bash
git commit -s
```
