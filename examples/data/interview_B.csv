0:01,Jordan Lee,"Thanks for joining today, Priya. Could you start by telling me about your role at BrightWave Technologies?"
0:06,Priya Sharma,"I’m a UX designer, focusing mainly on our SaaS platform. I handle wireframes, prototypes, and collaborate with developers to refine interfaces."
0:15,Jordan Lee,How long have you been working remotely?
0:18,Priya Sharma,Since March 2020. What was supposed to be a temporary arrangement became permanent.
0:25,Jordan Lee,How did that change your design process?
0:28,Priya Sharma,"A lot. Before, I sketched on whiteboards with teammates. Now I rely on Figma and digital sticky notes. It works, but it’s slower for idea generation."
0:36,Jordan Lee,What’s the biggest challenge in remote design collaboration?
0:40,Priya Sharma,Brainstorming. Energy drops when you’re staring at a screen. People multitask more. We’ve had to work harder to keep sessions engaging.
0:48,Jordan Lee,What tools have helped the most?
0:52,Priya Sharma,"Figma for designs, Slack huddles for quick syncs, and Notion for documentation. We also use Loom videos to explain design flows asynchronously."
1:00,Jordan Lee,How about communication with engineers?
1:04,Priya Sharma,"Mixed bag. It’s easier to document feedback, but harder to build rapport. Misunderstandings about design intent happen more often."
1:12,Jordan Lee,How do you make up for the lack of face-to-face?
1:15,Priya Sharma,"I schedule short “coffee chats.” No agenda, just talking. It helps recreate hallway conversations."
1:23,Jordan Lee,Has remote work influenced creativity?
1:27,Priya Sharma,"Yes, I think we lost spontaneity. Inspiration often came from random conversations. Now I intentionally block time for browsing inspiration boards or sharing design references."
1:35,Jordan Lee,What about your personal routine?
1:38,Priya Sharma,"I try to create boundaries. I dress like I’m going to the office, even though I’m at home. Otherwise, the days blur together."
1:46,Jordan Lee,Has BrightWave done anything to support designers remotely?
1:50,Priya Sharma,"They gave us stipends for home office gear, which helped. But more importantly, they introduced “no-meeting Fridays” to reduce Zoom fatigue."
1:58,Jordan Lee,How has remote work affected career growth for you?
2:02,Priya Sharma,It’s tricky. Visibility is harder. You can’t just walk into a manager’s office. I’ve had to be proactive in documenting achievements and asking for feedback.
2:10,Jordan Lee,Do you see yourself staying remote long-term?
2:14,Priya Sharma,"Probably hybrid. I miss the energy of in-person design jams, but I like the flexibility of remote."
2:22,Jordan Lee,What’s one improvement you’d like to see in remote collaboration tools?
2:26,Priya Sharma,Better integration of video with whiteboarding. Right now it feels like two separate worlds.
2:34,Jordan Lee,Any unexpected benefits of remote work?
2:38,Priya Sharma,Accessibility. We’ve been able to bring in external testers from different regions much more easily for usability studies.
2:46,Jordan Lee,What advice would you give junior designers about thriving remotely?
2:50,Priya Sharma,Document everything. Don’t rely on people remembering what you said in a call. And find ways to make yourself visible beyond your design files.
2:58,Jordan Lee,"Thanks, Priya. Anything else you’d like to add?"
3:01,Priya Sharma,"Just that design is still about people. Even remotely, it’s important to nurture human connections, not just push pixels."
